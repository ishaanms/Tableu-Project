## User Story - HR Dashboard ##
As an HR manager for the research wing of a Hospital, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed patient records for in-depth analysis
Summary View
- The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis
#### Overview
- The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:
- Display the total number of admitted patients, active patients, and released patients.
- Visualize the total number of admitted and released patients over the years.
- Present a breakdown of total patients by department and job titles.
- Compare total patients between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
- Show the distribution of patients by city and state.
#### Demographics
- The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of all the patients, including:
- Present the gender ratio among the patients.
- Visualize the distribution of patients across age groups and education levels.
- Show the total number of patients within each age group.
- Show the total number of patients within each education level.
- Present the correlation between patientâ€™s educational backgrounds and their health ratings.
#### Income
- The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:
- Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
- Present how the age correlate with the salary for patients in each department.
#### Patients Records View
- Provide a comprehensive list of all patients with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
- Users should be able to filter the list based on any of the available columns.
